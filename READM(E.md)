### Hi there, I'm Emily Deleon 👋

I’m a Systems Engineering and Design graduate from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, currently deepening my technical expertise through personal projects and continuous learning. My academic journey, rich in a blend of engineering disciplines and business systems integration, inspires my hands-on approach to technology and problem-solving.

🚀 **What I'm focusing on:** Currently, I'm using my spare time to explore various programming languages, build my personal website, and expand my technical portfolio. This includes experimenting with new trends in technology, crafting projects that enhance my coding skills, and dabbling in software tools like Python, SQL, and various API integrations.

🔍 **Looking to collaborate:** I’m not only keen on contributing to projects that integrate technology for success in business, but I am also passionate in applying my talents for social good, particularly in biotechnology and ethical tech. My experience in client-facing roles and managing diverse project teams enhances my ability to deliver impactful solutions.
